I am a PhD Student at the [University of Bielefeld](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de), Germany. I am co-supervised by [Prof. Martin Wahl](https://ekvv.uni-bielefeld.de/pers_publ/publ/PersonDetail.jsp?personId=397650776&lang=EN) (University of Bielefeld) and [Prof. Bernd Sturmfels](https://www.mpg.de/11383446/mathematik-in-den-naturwissenschaften-sturmfels) ([Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences](https://www.mis.mpg.de)).

Academic Interests
===
I am interested in applications of algebraic geometry, differential geometry and combinatorics in statistics. As data encountered in applications often take the form of low dimensional structures such as manifolds or algebraic varieties in high dimensional ambient spaces, these are the structures I am interested in. I am specifically interested in intersections of high dimensional convex bodies, and in Grassmanians. My long term goal is to unify statistics and algebraic statistics. 

Past Experience
===
I was a Master's student at [RPTU Kaiserslautern](https://rptu.de), Germany from 2021-2024, specializing in Computer Algebra and Algebraic Geometry. I completed my master's thesis "Free Resolutions over the Exterior Algebra with Parallel Structures" with the guidance of [Dr. Janko Boehm](https://agag-jboehm.math.rptu.de/~boehm/).  

I was a developer of the open source computer algebra systems [OSCAR](https://www.oscar-system.org) and [Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de). My contributions are visible in my [GitHub](https://github.com/Lax202).

I was a BS-MS student at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Mohali](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de), India from 2015-2020. I completed my masters degree in mathematics with the thesis "Affine Group Schemes" under the guidance of [Dr. Varadharaj Srinivasan](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/faculty/dms/ravisri).
