excerpt: 'The ABCT variety is defined as the closure of the image of G(2,n) under the Veronese map. We realize the ABCT variety V(3,n) as the determinantal variety of a vector bundle morphism. We use this to give a recursive formula for the fundamental class of V(3,n). As an application, we show that special Schubert coefficients of this class are given by Eulerian numbers, matching a formula by Cachazo-He-Yuan. On the way to this, we prove that the variety of configuration of points on a common divisor on a smooth variety is reduced and irreducible, generalizing a result of Caminata-Moon-Schaffler.'
